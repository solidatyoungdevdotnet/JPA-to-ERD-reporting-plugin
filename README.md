# JPA-to-ERD-reporting-plugin
This is a general plugin for creating a Vendor agnostic (Logical) ERD from JPA entities by reading the annotations.  
The resulting diagram should be logically correct even if not applicable to a given DB Vendor.  

## Coming soon
- new license (I'm leaning toward BSD but I need to check all the dependencies first)
- Clean up the actual report layout 
- refactor the code.  The code is fugly and I don't wan't future employers to look at it
- Code coverage
- Build a sample reference project
- document config
